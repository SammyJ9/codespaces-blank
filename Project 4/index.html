    <h2>A Review of HTML</h2>
    <p>Html is a very simple scripting languange. it consists of ordanary text, with elements that are enclosed by "<" and ">" characters. The best part of HTML is that once we know how to effectively use bacic elements, we can look up how to use all of the others.</p>

    <h1> Lists</h1>
    <p>below is a example of a nested list, usiing both an orderd list and a unorderd list:</P>
        <ol> 
        <li> First
        <li> Second 
       <li> Third
       </li>
        <ul>

         <h1> Links </h1>
         <p> links are very usefull, and help users to quickly nagivate to new pages, both within outside the current website.</p>
         <p> For instance, they can quickly direct users to <a href= "http://www.google.com">googles homepage.</a></p>
         <p> <a href="mailto:sjimenez@mamkschools.org">emails</a> can also be easily sent through the use of links. </p>
         <p> <a href="#top">They can even even bring user to a certain place within the webpage</a></p>

         <p style="text=align:left;">sometimes we want to go ahead and align pictures to the left line of the text. Using the "align" attribute, with a value of "left" is a perfect way to do this. You can also align the picture to the right of the text by replacing the value in "align" attribute to the "right" </p>
