            <p>The best burger recipe for summertime grilling! This juicy burger is jam-packed with all kinds of stuff and has no tasteless bread crumbs. Serve on buns with your favorite condiments.</p>
        <h2>Directions: Step 1 </h2>
            <p> Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</p>
        <h3>Step 2.</h3>    
            <p>Meanwhile, combine ground beef, onion, cheese, egg, onion soup mix, minced garlic, garlic powder, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, parsley, basil, oregano, rosemary, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Use your hands to form the mixture into 4 patties.</p>
            <h4>Step 3.</h4>
            <p>Cook patties on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).<sup2</sup>.</p>
